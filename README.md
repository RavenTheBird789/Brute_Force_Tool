# Brute_Force_Tool
Simple python brute force tool that includes several modified versions of an already existing one I saw on Instagram.

brute_force_tool is the original code I copied and pasted from an Instagram reel and brute_force_tool2 is the modified version I made with the random library in python to include all characters available on a keyboard instead of just base ten values (0-9). I also made brute_force_tool3 which is a numerical password brute force tool similar to the original (brute_force_tool) but was modified to show the amount of attempts made to brute force the password rather than spamming the terminal with each attempt along with additional text.

To run, simply type "git clone https://github.com/RavenTheBird789/Brute_Force_Tool" in your terminal and "python3 brute_force_tool.py", "python3 brute_force_tool2.py", or "python3 brute_force_tool3.py" to execute this program

(NOTE: This program was created for purely educational purpose to display how a hypothetical brute force tool would function)
