# Brute_Force_Tool
Simple python brute force tool that's a modification of an already existing one I saw on Instagram.

brute_force_tool is the original code I copied and pasted from an Instagram reel and brute_force_tool2 is the modified version I made with the random library in python to include all characters available on a keyboard instead of just base ten values (0-9).

To run, simply type "git clone https://github.com/RavenTheBird789/Brute_Force_Tool" in your terminal and "python3 brute_force_tool.py" or "python3 brute_force_tool2.py" to execute this program

(NOTE: This program was created for purely educational purpose to display how a hypothetical brute force tool would function)
